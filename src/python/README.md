This is a Python script that uses the OpenAI API to perform text-based chat with the GPT-3.5 Turbo language model. The script sends a message as input to the API and receives a response message from the API.

Requirements
To use this script, you need to have an OpenAI API key. You can sign up for an API key at https://beta.openai.com/signup/.

You also need to have the 
requests
 and 
json
 Python modules installed. You can install these modules using pip:

pip install requests
pip install json
How to Use
To use the script, run it in a Python environment that has access to your OpenAI API key. You can set your API key in an environment variable called 
OPENAI_API_KEY.

When you run the script, you will see a prompt asking you to type your message. Type your message and press Enter to send it to the API. The script will then display the response message from the API.

The script keeps track of the chat history, which is stored in the CHAT_HISTORY list.

To quit the script, type "q" and press Enter.
